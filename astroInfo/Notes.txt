TODO:
  - work on adapting detection algorithm to be more accurate
    - compare multiple attributes at once rather than just highest/lowest outliers overall
  - work on adapting program to work on incoming stream of data, not just set data --> may need to do some research on this









ASTEROID ATTRIBUTES & MEANINGS:

RB:
    Good = value of 1
    Interesting if value is generally mediocre then spikes in "accuracy"
    Intersting if value is generally high then dips in "accuracy" (especcialy 


ELONG:
    value of 1 is perfect circle, value greater than 1 is more elongated
    Interesting if if value is high


H:
    normalized to phaseangle
    lower value = brighter
    higher value = dimmer


MAG18OMAG8:
    Good = value closer to zero
    Interesting if the number of sigmas is high (away from zero)
    Not as interesting if magpsf or H are also lower values (brighter)
    
    
    
    
Best possible case for outlier
    * RB down
    * elong up
    * H down
    * mag18omag8 up
    
    
    
Flag outliers in 1 feature first, then compare to other features to see if it is also an outlier (as above)



Potentially Interesting Asteroids:
* 99928
* 9937
* 99970
* 6478 (Gault)
* 99936
* 98726

# How this program works:                                                              #
# The program accepts a number of asteroids to observe and value for where in the data #
# to start. Then, it pulls data for each individual asteroid, and finds the most       #
# outlying point (min or max) and calculates the number of standard deviations away    #
# from the mean that point is. If it is above the mean, the number of sigmas is stored #
# in the matrix. If it is below the mean, the negative number of sigmas is stored in   #
# the matrix. The final columns in the matrix are a row sum (of sigma multipliers) and #
# a row sum of the absolute value of each matrix entry. The program then allows users  #
# to filter the data by features at specific user-given values. Then users can view    #
# histograms of all the sigma data and scatterplots for individual asteroids           #
